# Peril

## Requirements
- Oscillator/LFO (Working on hard/soft sync)
  - Need to implement Wavetable
- Physical Modelling (Need to implement from scratch)
- Noise (Need to modify old one)
- Sampler (Need to modify old one, possibly implement with ScriptProcessor)
- Filter (Need to implement from scratch)
- Envelope (Need to implement from scratch)
  - AR/Perc with slope change
  - ADR
  - ADSR
- Sequencer (Need to modify old one and converge with mark2)
- Utility (Need to modify old one)
- Reverb (Need to modify old one)
  - Record some IR
- Delay (Need to modify old one)
  - Implement some effects
- Effects
  - Distortion
  - Amp simulation
    - Maybe record IR for this too
- Pad
  - This will be like SynthDef in Supercollider
- MIDI (Need to implement from scratch)
- Oscilloscope (Need to modify old one)
